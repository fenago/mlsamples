        "\n",
        "Hello Guys, \n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, we will be building a Text Summarization Web Application in Flask, Python. Before getting too much technical about the inner workings of the application, Let me first demonstrate the working of this application. First, when we build the complete application, we will be greeted with the following screen:\n",
        "\n",
        "<img src = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datageekrj/ForHostingFiles/master/display1.PNG\">\n",
        "\n",
        "Take a good look at the various pieces which are mentioned in the above application. So, there is a Input Field which says `Enter your text here` and then there is a `submit` button which is for submitting and getting the summarized version of the input text.   \n",
        "\n",
        "Now, to demonstrate you the workings of the application, what i have done is taken the following piece of text from [Hyperparameter Tuning](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-hyperparameters-optimization-in-deep-learning-models-concepts-and-tools-357002a3338a) and copy and pasted it to the following input field.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Model optimization is one of the toughest challenges in the implementation of machine learning solutions. Entire branches of machine learning and deep learning theory have been dedicated to the optimization of models. Typically, we think about model optimization as a process of regularly modifying the code of the model in order to minimize the testing error. However, deep learning optimization often entails fine tuning elements that live outside the model but that can heavily influence its behavior. Deep learning often refers to those hidden elements as hyperparameters as they are one of the most critical components of any machine learning application.\n",
        "Hyperparameters are settings that can be tuned to control the behavior of a machine learning algorithm. Conceptually, hyperparameters can be considered orthogonal to the learning model itself in the sense that, although they live outside the model, there is a direct relationship between them.\n",
        "The criteria of what defines a hyperparameter is incredibly abstract and flexible. Sure, there are well established hyperparameters such as the number of hidden units or the learning rate of a model but there are also an arbitrarily number of settings that can play the role of hyperparameters for specific models. In general, hyperparameters are very specific to the type of machine learning model you are trying to optimize. Sometimes, a setting is modeled as a hyperparameter because is not appropriate to learn it from the training set. A classic example are settings that control the capacity of a model (the spectrum of functions that the model can represent). If a deep learning algorithm learns those settings directly from the training set, then it is likely to try to optimize for that dataset which will cause the model to overfit( poor generalization).\n",
        "If hyperparameters are not learned from the training set, then how does a model learn them? Remember that classic rule in machine learning models to split the input dataset in an 80/20 percent ratio between the training set and the validation set respectively? Well, part of the role of that 20% validation set is to guide the selection of hyperparameters. Technically, the validation set is used to “train” the hyperparameters prior to optimization.**\n",
